		The Rock of Jesus Christ Deliverance Church is dedicated to making a lasting impact through Discipleship Program. In the program, we equip disciples with the knowledge and wisdom that they need to help themselves and others navigate the complexities of life with faith and clarity.

Led by Jesus Christ, our Discipleship Program aims to foster a deep connection between individuals and the Word of God. By diligent study, reflection, and open dialogue, we work to make an environment where the Scriptures come alive, brightening the path to salvation and empowering disciples to live their lives according to God's divine plan.

At the core of our program is a unique method of Bible study, ensuring minimal scripture misinterpretation. We understand the negative impact that misinterpretation can have on one's faith journey, leading to confusion, doubt, and even division. Therefore, we have developed a rigorous system of representation, carefully matching each disciple with specific scripture passages that resonate with their spiritual needs and calling.

In the Discipleship Program, disciples become representatives of the Scriptures, embodying the wisdom found in the scriptures. They are equipped to navigate the complexities of life, providing guidance and support to those seeking answers. With a profound understanding of the Scriptures, our disciples serve as beacons of light, inspiring and uplifting others as they journey together toward a deeper relationship with God.

We invite you to join us in our mission to empower lives and transform communities. By supporting our Discipleship Program, you are investing in the well-being of individuals who will, in turn, impact countless others. Your generous contributions will enable us to expand our program, reach more individuals, and make a lasting ripple effect of positive change.

Donate now and be a part of the Discipleship Program. For together, we shape a future where the Word of God enlightens, empowers, and unites us all.
