	<p>THE ROCK OF JESUS CHRIST DELIVERANCE CHURCH, IN ITS MISSION TO GATHER AND UNITE PEOPLE AS A FELLOWSHIP OF BELIEVERS ON THE FULL BALANCE DOCTRINE OF HOLINESS, FAITH, LOVE, PEACE, 
		HEALING, AND DELIVERANCE IN JESUS CHRIST, IS COMMITTED TO THE <a class="hire-dp" href="index.html">DISCIPLESHIP PROGRAM</a>. THIS PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL IN FOSTERING OUR 
		AIM TO WORSHIP GOD IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH AND BE TAUGHT FROM THE WORD OF GOD, UNDER THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. </p>

<p>OUR DISCIPLESHIP PROGRAM IS NOT MERELY ABOUT KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; IT IS A DEDICATION TO ENSURING THAT EVERY DISCIPLE, THROUGH DILIGENT STUDY, REFLECTION, AND OPEN DIALOGUE, EXPERIENCES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE SCRIPTURES COME ALIVE. 
		OUR AIM IS TO BRIGHTEN THE PATH TO SALVATION, ENSURING MINIMAL SCRIPTURE MISINTERPRETATION, AND EMPOWER DISCIPLES TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF LIFE WITH FAITH AND CLARITY. 
UNDERSTANDING THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF SCRIPTURE MISINTERPRETATION, WHICH CAN LEAD TO CONFUSION, DOUBT, AND EVEN DIVISION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A RIGOROUS SYSTEM THAT MATCHES EACH DISCIPLE WITH SPECIFIC SCRIPTURE PASSAGES RESONATING 
		WITH THEIR SPIRITUAL NEEDS AND CALLING.</p>

<p>FURTHERMORE, OUR COMMITMENT TO PROCLAIMING AND TEACHING THE GOSPEL ENSURES THAT THE LOST ARE SAVED, EMPHASIZING THE NEED TO BELIEVE, REPENT, BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST 
		(ACT 2:1-4). BY THIS, DISCIPLES BECOME REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SCRIPTURES, PROPAGATING THE THREE ASPECTS OF THE PROSPERITY OF A CHRISTIAN LIFE AS OUTLINED IN 3 JOHN 1:2 AND ENSURING THEY MAKE ETERNITY IN HEAVEN.</p>

<p>TO SOLIDIFY OUR DEDICATION TO THE WORD OF GOD'S STANDARD, WE PROVIDE AND NURTURE RULES OF CHRISTIAN CONDUCT AND HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING AND DEVELOPING A PLACE OF WORSHIP AND HOUSE OF PRAYER. 
		AS OUR DISCIPLES SERVE AS BEACONS OF LIGHT, WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN OUR JOURNEY, ENSURING THAT BY SUPPORTING THE DISCIPLESHIP PROGRAM, YOU INVEST IN A FUTURE WHERE THE WORD OF GOD ENLIGHTENS, EMPOWERS, AND UNITES US ALL.
