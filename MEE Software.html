        <h2>Understanding Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>
        <p><strong>What are Mutually Exclusive Events?</strong></p>
        <p>Imagine you are tossing a coin. It can land either heads or tails, but not both at the same time. These outcomes are mutually exclusive events—they cannot happen simultaneously. In real-life scenarios, mutually exclusive events occur more frequently than you might think.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In Business:</strong> A customer either purchases a product or doesn’t.</li>
            <li><strong>In Finance:</strong> The market either goes up or down in a given period.</li>
            <li><strong>In Daily Life:</strong> You either arrive on time or you’re late.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our software is designed to handle these kinds of events, even when their probabilities are not known beforehand.</p>
