    <h2>Understanding Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>
    <p><strong>What are Mutually Exclusive Events?</strong><br>
        Imagine you are tossing a coin. It can land either heads or tails, but not both at the same time. These outcomes are mutually exclusive events—they cannot happen simultaneously. In real-life scenarios, mutually exclusive events occur more frequently than you might think.</p>
